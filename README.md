# LOW COST OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR


COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March 2020. While all countries are working hard to cope with the sharp rise in infections, the existing healthcare capacity even in developed countries appears to be falling short of the real need.  

India, home to over 1.3 billion people, has a fragmented health care system with an inadequate public health infrastructure. Some reports estimate that the country might reach the peak during November,2020. The number of the patients is already outgrowing the medical facilities available posing a serious challenge of accommodation of mass hospitalization during the peak of the outbreak in India. Many patients with mild case of COVID-19 with some minor respiratory issues can be treated in their homes by following all safety protocols laid out by WHO, but the cost of respiratory assist devices is very high and many cannot afford it.

The aim of this project is to create a basis for a low-cost oxygen concentrator. An Oxygen concentrator is a device that concentrates oxygen from a gas supply (here, atmospheric air) by selectively removing nitrogen, carbon dioxide and moisture from it to produce oxygen enriched gas stream. The method employed here is the pressure swing adsorption technique.  This device though available in the market, costs around INR 50,000 â€“ INR 1,20,000. In a country where the average income per person is about INR 1,25,000.00, it is clearly not possible for the majority of the population to afford it. 

Hence, we came up with the idea of a low-cost Oxygen concentrator whose production cost would be significantly lower than the available commercial devices. The production cost is estimated to be around INR 5,000.

The low-cost oxygen concentrator works on the principle of adsorption. 
#### "Adsorption is a surface phenomenon that causes the accumulation of atoms, molecules or ions on certain solid surfaces at solid-gas or solid-liquid interface." 
The substance getting adsorbed is adsorbate and the surface on which it is getting adsorbed is called adsorbent. Under pressure, certain adsorbents selectively adsorb one of the gas in a mixture of gases. Zeolite pellets are very effective in selectively adsorbing N2 molecules from the air. This is our primary component as air is composed of 78% N2 gas. Hence filtering it out will leave us with oxygen rich air.  The efficiency of zeolites will be reduced in the presence of CO2 and moisture. Hence, we will purify the air by first filtering out carbon di-oxide and moisture.This can be achieved by treating the compressed air from the room with KOH pellets. KOH reacts with to CO2 produce K2CO3 along with moisture. The reaction proceeds as follows: 

#### 2.KOH + CO2 ---> K2CO3 +  H2O 

After removal of CO2, the compressed air stream is then run through a chamber of silica gel beads. The silica gel adsorbs moisture making the air stream dry.  This dry air stream is then passed into the zeolite pellet chamber for filtration of N2. After the filtration process is complete, the oxygen rich air stream is delivered to the patient. The N2 cleansing chamber, CO2 cleansing chamber and the H2O adsorbing chambers need to be replenished when the adsorbents are exhausted. 

They are easy to replace and are inexpensive and available everywhere.  The flow of the gases in and out of the chambers is controlled by valves that are timed accordingly to ensure the process runs smooth. An electric micro air pump and an air compressor is used to draw in air from the room and reduce its pressure. 

The complete process occurs in two cycles. In the first cycle, the first zeolite chamber adsorbs N2 and enriches O2 concentration in the stream of air; meanwhile the second zeolite chamber de-adsorbs N2 and releases it back to the room. In the second cycle,  the first zeolite chamber de-adsorbs the N2 from preivious cycle while second zeolite chamber adsorbs N2 and enriches O2 concentration in the air stream. This way, by alternating mechanism, we maintain the continous oxygen enriched air stream for the patient as long as system is powered.
